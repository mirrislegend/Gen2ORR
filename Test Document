Tests For Rendezvous Server

//SERVER SIDE CODE\\

1. Hard code relay-entry and enter it into the relay_table. Print the entry's port number to show the system works.

2. Call setUpRelayTable and then print each entry's port number

3. Test the add_to_relay method by creating a faux address and then printing the address and/or port number.

4. Test serve and setUpServerSocket

5. Check on client side by comparing port numbers to make sure the port numbers have actually been changed

//CLIENT SIDE CODE\\

1. Test line 91, that is, make sure the read() function call that returns the port number actually works

2. Call client_serve and see whether it works?

//I'm just testing if I can commit and push on my repository of Nifemi's work without effecting Nifemi's repository
